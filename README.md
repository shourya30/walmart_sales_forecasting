# Walmart Time-Series Forecasting using ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing

## Problem Statement

Walmart, a leading retail corporation, operates 45 stores across various regions, each comprising multiple departments. They have provided weekly sales data for these departments, aiming to forecast department-wise sales per store. Throughout the year, Walmart conducts promotional markdown events, especially before major holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, and Labor Day. Sales during these holiday weeks are weighted five times more in evaluations than non-holiday weeks. A challenge lies in modeling the impact of markdowns during these holidays, given the incomplete historical data.â€‹
